Owning an NFT is in most of the cases seen as a part of being a DAO or Community but sharing your address related to that NFT often exposes much of other details linked with that wallet.

We want to solve this 

I own a cryptopunk or simply any asset at my address but I don't want to share my address with everyone as It could have other txnâ€™s linked to it on the public blockchain.

So we will  give users the option to prove that they own an asset without explictly sharing all the details linked with it.
